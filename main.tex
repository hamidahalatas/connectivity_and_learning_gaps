%%%%%% Abstract %%%%%%
\begin{abstract}
This study aims to comprehensively analyze the potential trade-off between the short-term and long-term costs and benefits of vocational versus general education in Indonesia. Using the data from the 1993-2014 panel survey of the Indonesian Family Life Survey, I test the trade-off by employing difference-in-difference regression across different ages. The study finds that while having vocational graduates have an advantageous position early in their careers, the effect diminishes with age. The effect is strong for men's employment probability compared to women. Moreover, using sequence analysis, this study finds that youth's employment status early in their career trajectory is more likely to continue or predict their employment status later in their lives. These employment patterns, however, do not differ by education type. These two findings indicate that while, on average, being in general education benefits youth later in their career life, individual career paths are more likely to be affected by their early employment status.

%%%%%% Figures %%%%%%
\subsection*{Figures}
Figures should be called out within the text and numbered in the order of their citation in the text. Every figure must have a descriptive title beginning with ``Figure [Number] …'' All figure titles should be either a phrase or a sentence; do not mix the two styles. See Figure \ref{fig:1} for example.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{indonesia_learning_gap.png}
    \caption{This is an example figure.}
    \label{fig:1}
\end{figure}

Figures should be displayed on a white background. When preparing figures, consider that they can occupy either a single column (half page width) or two columns (full page width), and should be sized accordingly.

If a figure consists of multiple panels, they should be ordered logically and labelled with roman letters (i.e., A, B, C, etc.). All labels should be explained in the legend. See Figure \ref{fig:2} for example.

Upon acceptance, authors will be asked to provide the figures as separate electronic files. At that stage, figures should be supplied as Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), PostScript (PS), or Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) for illustrations or diagrams; Tagged Image File Format (TIFF), JPEG, PNG, PhotoShop (PSD), EPS, or PDF for photography or microscopy. Bitmap (BMP) images should be of at least 300 dpi resolution, unless due to the limited resolution of a scientific instrument. If a bitmap image has labels, the image and labels should be embedded in separate layers.

\subsection{Experimental Design}
Begin with a section titled Experimental Design describing the objectives and design of the study as well as prespecified components. 

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}
If applicable, include a section titled Statistical Analysis that fully describes the statistical methods with enough detail to enable a knowledgeable reader with access to the original data to verify the results. The values for N, P, and the specific statistical test performed for each experiment should be included in the appropriate figure legend or main text. 

\subsection{Human and Animal Studies}
For investigations on humans, a statement must be including indicating that informed consent was obtained after the nature and possible consequences of the study was explained.

For authors using experimental animals, a statement must be included indicating that the animals’ care was in accordance with institutional guidelines.

\section{Results}
The results should describe the experiments performed and the findings observed. The results section should be divided into subsections to delineate different experimental themes. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item All data should be presented in the Results. No data should be presented for the first time in the Discussion. Data (such as from Western blots) should be appropriately quantified.
    \item Subheadings must be either all complete sentences or all phrases. They should be brief, ideally less than 10 words. Subheadings should not end in a period. Your paper may have as many subheadings as are necessary.
    \item Figures and tables must be called out in numerical order. For example, the first mention of any panel of Fig. 3 cannot precede the first mention of all panels of Fig. 2. The supplementary figures (for example, fig. S1) and tables (table S1) must also be called out in numerical order. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
Include a Discussion that summarizes (but does not merely repeat) your conclusions and elaborates on their implications. There should be a paragraph outlining the limitations of your results and interpretation, as well as a discussion of the steps that need to be taken for the findings to be applied. Please avoid claims of priority. 

\section*{Acknowledgments}

\subsection*{Conflicts of Interest}
Conflicts of interest (COIs, also known as ``competing interests'') occur when issues outside research could be reasonably perceived to affect the neutrality or objectivity of the work or its assessment. 

Authors must declare all potential interests – whether or not they actually had an influence – in a ‘Conflicts of Interest’ section, which should explain why the interest may be a conflict. Authors must declare current or recent funding (including for Article Processing Charges) and other payments, goods or services that might influence the work. All funding, whether a conflict or not, must be declared in a ``Funding Statement.'' The involvement of anyone other than the authors who 1) has an interest in the outcome of the work; 2) is affiliated to an organization with such an interest; or 3) was employed or paid by a funder, in the commissioning, conception, planning, design, conduct, or analysis of the work, the preparation or editing of the manuscript, or the decision to publish must be declared.

If there are none, the authors should state ``The author(s) declare(s) that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this article.'' Submitting authors are responsible for coauthors declaring their interests. Declared conflicts of interest will be considered by the editor and reviewers and included in the published article.

\subsection*{Data Availability}
